Peppadew: The Best Cat in the World
===================================

Peppadew is my 17.5lb orange tabby cat. He's flabby, _loves treats_, and needs to be in your lap at all times.

### Here is a list of other things he loves

1. Food, but only one brand.
2. Sleeping 18 hours at a time
3. A malfunctioning bird toy that makes dying electronic tweets.
4. Scratching furniture
5. Sun spots
6. Being on the porch 
7. Paper bags
8. Treats at EXACTLY 10pm every night
9. Feet and shoes.
10. Feet and shoes he's never smelled before.

### This is what people have to say about him

#### My roommate 
>"He steps on my bladder in the morning to wake me up."

#### My friend Diz
>"He's a prince."

#### Roommate's partner
>"Oh god. Why does he like my shoes so much????"
